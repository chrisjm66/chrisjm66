## Hello! My name is Chris.

#### I enjoy learning about computers and aviation, and have been working with websites for about a year and a half now. 
#### I also study Computer Science at Brookdale Community College and fly small airplanes out of a local airport, with plans to become a flight instructor in the near future!
