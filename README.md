## Hello! My name is Chris.

![js](./javascript)
#### I enjoy learning about computers and aviation, and have been working with websites for about a year and a half now. I study Computer Science at Brookdale Community College in Lincroft, NJ.
#### I also fly small airplanes out of a local airport, with plans to become a flight instructor in the near future!


Some current projects that I have worked on include a personal website for myself and a virtual card game created as a final project in my Programming II class!
